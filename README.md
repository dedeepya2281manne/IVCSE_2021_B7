 User-Interface 
Step 1 : Create a folder and place dataset1.txt,dataset2.txt,proj2.py files in it.
Step 2 : Create a folder with name templates in the previous folder.
Step 3 : Place the homepage2.html file in templates folder.
Step 4 : Open command prompt and Set the location where the python file (proj2.py)  is located
Step 5 : Run the python (proj2.py) file
Step 6 : Click on the link generated
Step 7 : Paste it on the browser and Enter the values and click on the predict button
Step 8 : The output is displayed
