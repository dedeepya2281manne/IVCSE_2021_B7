5. Project Execution Steps

	1 : Create a folder and place dataset1.txt,dataset2.txt,proj2.py files in it.
	2 : Create a folder with name templates in the previous folder.
	3 : Place the homepage2.html file in templates folder.
	4 : Open command prompt and Set the location where the python file (proj2.py)  is located
	5 : Run the python (proj2.py) file
	6 : Click on the link generated
	7 : Paste it on the browser and Enter the values and click on the predict button
	8 : The output is displayed
